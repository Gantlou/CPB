## CPB TA Demo - Capacitive Touch

### Use case: 

This is a demo of using capacitive touch to make Rudolph's nose light up red.

### What it does: 

Rudolph's nose lights up when someone touches his antlers or his scarf.

### How it works:

This utilizes the bluefruit's on-board capacitive touch. The conductive tape and conductive fabric are directly attached to the specified pins and the user's touch changes the capacitance of the system. The lights turn on when the bluefruit recognizes the change in capacitance.

### Peripherals:

**Digital Inputs:**
On-board capacitive touch

**Serial I/O:**
On-board neopixels
