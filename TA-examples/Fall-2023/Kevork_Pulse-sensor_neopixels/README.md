This is a demo of a shirt that tracks your heart rate and lets you and others around you know when it is getting too high!

The heartrate sensor sends an analog input to the CPB. The circuit python program then converts the input from the heart rate sensor into beats per minute. Then, the CPB flashes the onboard neopixel at the correct frequency to reflect the calculated BPM. Once the BPM gets to be too high, the CPB not only flashes the onboard neopixels red, but also flashes the connected neopixels red through serial I/O communication and flashes the sewn-on LED sequins red using a digital output.

Analog Input/Sensors:
Heart Rate Sensor

Digital Output:
LED Sequins
