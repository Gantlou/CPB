## Digital Paint Mixer

### Use Case: 
Help users learn how RGB values work analogous to mixing paint

### What it Does: 

Captures two separate colors indicated by a light and sound countdown and a camera capture sound, and then mixes their rgb values when the apparatus is shaken accompanied by a swirling water sound and the swirling of the neopixel input indicators

### How it Works: 
Color Sensor captures the input and sets it to one of two inputs corresponding to onboard buttons. Does countdown and then reads in input Accelerometer detects if the apparatus is shaken, and if so, swirls the onboard neopixels and plays a swirling sound The RGB tuples for the inputs are added and then outputted to the neopixels, with the output set as both inputs afterwards.

**Analog Input/Sensors:**
Heart Rate Sensor

**Digital Output:**
LED Sequins

**Serial I/O:**
Onboard Neopixels
Offboard Neopixels
