## CPB TA Demo - Reed switch, vibe motor, and conductive velcro

### Use case: 

This is a demo for a wearable device for a user who stores 

### What it does: 

Attaches to users back pocket. Will vibrate once the wallet is removed from the pocket to alert the user that it has been stolen.

### How it works:

System is attached to user's pocket using conductive velcro. The system will only activate if the conductive velcro is connected. Then, a magnet in the wallet activates the reed switch in the system. Once the wallet is taken and the magnetic field is removed, the vibe motor begins vibrating.

### Peripherals:

**Digital Inputs:** 
Reed Switch, conductive velcro

**Digital Outputs:**
Vibe motor
