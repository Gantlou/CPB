## Myoware Muscle Sensor Cuff

### Use case: 

When you're working out, you want to make sure that you are fully engaging and working out the muscle groups that you are targeting. However, it can be difficult to determine if you are properly training a certain muscle group. 
### What it does: 

The Myoware Muscle Sensor Cuff, using electromyography, measures the strength of the electrical signals that your muscles produce when it they are activated, with as stronger signals corresponding to higher muscle activation. The 10-neopixel ring light up, with the number of rings that light up being linked to how strong your muscles work.

### How it works:

The Myoware Muscle Sensor, reads in the musclar electrical activity and outputs a simple analog signal between 0 and +Vcc volts proportional to the sensed electrical activity. The CPB reads in this analog value and uses this to control the number of lights that are lit on board the Bluefruit.
